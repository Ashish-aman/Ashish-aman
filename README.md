# Hi there, I'm Ashish Aman ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring data scientist and a dedicated student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Jodhpur. My passion lies in leveraging data to solve complex problems, and I specialize in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. With a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and optimization, I'm equipped to tackle the most challenging data-driven projects.


## About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently student of IIT Jodhpur Pursuing Masters on [Data and Computational Science].
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continually learning and exploring new techniques in ML, DL, and CV.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on open-source projects and research opportunities.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking guidance on [Visual Question Answering:Research area which is intersection of Computer Vison and Natural Language Theory].
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data science, machine learning, deep learning, and vision and knowledge based areas of reaesarch.
- ðŸ“« Reach out to me on [Gmail]([amanashish3011@gmail.com]), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishaman3011/) or ,[Twitter](https://twitter.com/singh_chiraagAA/).

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Mood Transition Using Song Recommendation System](https://github.com/Ashish-aman/Mood-Transition_system_Using_Song):
- [Table Detection](https://github.com/Ashish-aman/CV_PROJECT2_TABLE_DETECT):Here we have detected the table from various method and shown the comparision by training 255 annotated image of tables and validating 26 images for the YoloV5 /YoloV8n and also detected and converted the table data into data-frame using basic open-CV libraries and CV techniques
- [Blend-Invision:Object Segmentation and Blending with its background](https://github.com/Ashish-aman/CV_PROJECT): Unwanted object removal is a common task in many computer vision and image processing systems. One of the most popular techniques for object removal is image inpainting, which involves filling in the missing or damaged portions of a picture with information from the surrounding area. In this article, we provide a method for removing objects from photos that is based on inpainting using two ways and compare the results. We focus on cv2.INPAINT TELEA ,cv2.INPAINT NS and averaging neighbouring pixel, two commonly used OpenCV picture inpainting methods. We discuss the underlying principles of these methods as well as their benefits and drawbacks for eliminating things
- [Virtual_JAMBOARD :Tool to write using fingers in air](https://github.com/Ashish-aman/Virtual_JAMBOARD_opencv):Virtual Jam-board,"Virtual Paint Jam-board" simulates the experience of painting with hands from any range under focussed vision of computer. To accomplish this, it uses open CV and CV Zone to detect hand gestures. It starts by detecting the hand and marking a landmark, then focuses on the index finger and middle finger.
